# Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

# [1, 2, 3, 4], mid = 2; 2 x 2 is too small so so we move left pointer to mid + 1
# [3, 4], mid = 3 ; 3 x 3 is too big so we move right pointer to mid - 1
# [2], mid = 2;  right pointer is now less than left pointer therefore loop breaks and 2 is returned
